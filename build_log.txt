(node:2226) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/rustamkarimov/DEV/GRIDIX%20LANDING/gridix-next/tailwind.config.ts?id=1767010155333 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/rustamkarimov/DEV/GRIDIX LANDING/gridix-next/package.json.
